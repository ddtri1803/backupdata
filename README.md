# backupdata
This will backup mysql/data your current mysql/data and replace it with the backup data.
As highlighted by some users, this is merely a temporary workaround and not a permanent fix. It’s strongly advised that once you’ve recovered your data, you back it up and then reinstall XAMPP, since the issue is related to a malfunction in certain XAMPP files rather than the databases themselves.

# Explanation of the sections:
**Test-PathAndExit function**: Checks if a path exists and exits the script if it doesn't.
**Confirm-Action function**: Requires confirmation from the user before taking important actions.
**Back up old data with timestamps**: Create backup folder names based on the current time to avoid overwriting old backups.
Explanation of the upgrade sections:: Added tests and error messages to ensure the script runs smoothly and users are aware of issues that arise.
In this way, the script becomes more secure and robust, minimizing the risk of data loss and providing more useful information to the user.
